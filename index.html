        <p>I am an inquisitive developer with a desire to hone my skills as a software developer.</p>
        <p>While in my undergrad, I took some coding classes that piqued my interest and set me on the path I am today. As a student at Thinkful, I am excited to take the next step in my software development career.</p>
